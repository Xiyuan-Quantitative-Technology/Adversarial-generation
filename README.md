# Adversarial generations of efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecules
In order to run the code, python packages including (but not limited) deepchem, pytorch, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib should be installed.

BRICS contains the synthetic process for the original D1A1 space.
DNN contains molecular property prediction by using the ECFP fingerprint. Note that the labeled samples are partitioned into training, validation, and test sets, to be used for the training, hyperparametrization, and generalization, respectively. 
AAE contains the molecular generation using adversarial autoencoder.
